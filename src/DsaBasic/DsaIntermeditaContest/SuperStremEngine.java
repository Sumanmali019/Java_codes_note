 *Problem Description :-
 *You've just been hired as a network engineer at SuperStream, a leading video streaming service. One of your first tasks is to optimize the number of video data packets sent to users based on their internet connectivity.
 *When a user hits "play," video data is transmitted in packets. If their device acknowledges these packets quickly, it means they have a strong connection and can receive more packets simultaneously for smoother streaming. If acknowledgments lag, fewer packets should be sent to prevent buffering.
 *Given an array A, where each entry represents the acknowledgment time (in milliseconds) for individual packets, and two integers B and C, can you determine if there's a continuous sequence of B packets with an average acknowledgment time less than or equal to Â°C milliseconds? If so, it's a green signal (integer 1) to send more packets. Otherwise, it's time to throttle back (integer 0).
